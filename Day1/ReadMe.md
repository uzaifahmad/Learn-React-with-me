# React Learning Journey - Day 1

## Setting Up the Development Environment

In this first day of our React learning journey, we will focus on setting up the development environment for React. Having a proper development environment is essential for building React applications efficiently.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm comes bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

### Create a New React Project

To create a new React project, we will use a tool called Create React App. It sets up a new React project with the necessary configurations and dependencies.

Follow these steps to create a new React project:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
3. Run the following command to create a new React project:

```shell
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```
Replace my-react-app with the desired name for your project.

Once the command finishes executing, navigate into the project directory:

```shell
Copy code
cd my-react-app

Commit: Initial Project Setup
Commit your code to mark the initial project setup. You can use Git version control to create a new commit with the following message:

```shell
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"

Congratulations! You have set up the development environment for your React project. Now you're ready to dive into building React components and exploring the world of React!

Stay tuned for Day 2, where we will cover React basics and create our first component.
